			problem:
Here is a sample line of code that can be executed in Python:

print("Hello, World!")
You can just as easily store a string as a variable and then print it to stdout:

my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string)
The above code will print Hello, World! on your screen. Try it yourself in the editor below!

			solution:

# Read a full line of input from stdin and save it to our dynamically typed variable, input_string.
input_string = input()

# Print a string literal saying "Hello, World." to stdout.
print('Hello, World.')

# TODO: Write a line of code here that prints the contents of input_string to stdout.
print(input_string)
